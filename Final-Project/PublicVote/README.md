Studio, Lab, Javascript
========================

Studio Environments with Justin Blinder, Lab with Micheal Wolf, and Javascript with Owen Herterich, Spring 2015. A voting system that collects data from the passage of people though a space. Made using an Arduino Uno, Node.js, Socket.io.js, Johnny-Five, and Processing.js

The ultimate goal of this project will be
to set up in a public space where people
are frequently moving in and out of.
Examples of ideal locations would be near an elevator,
in a door entrance, or in a hallway.
This is a passive voting system, where voters cast
their ballot effortlessly by moving
through space towards their desination.

This is the functioning skeletal framework for implementing such a system.
Special thanks to Aaron Hill for implementing the javascript server, to 
the makers of the Johnny-Five library, and to the people
who developed Arduino's standard firmata sketch, which allows microcontroller
communication to connected devices.
